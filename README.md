## Desk Bells

*Song transcriptions rendered simply with instrument selector, available transpositions, and chord backing*

A small selection of songs have been transcribed to JSON. The web application renders song notes as colored dots with chord backings overlaid. The colors correspond to individual notes on common children's instruments that cover the `C-c` diatonic range - you know, only the white notes on the piano starting and ending with `C`.

Do, a dear, a female dear. Yeah, those ones :slightly_smiling_face:

We have [desk bells](https://rhythmband.com/collections/bells/products/8-note-kidsplay-desk-bell-set "Rhythm Band Instruments") in my house. They're a fantastic first instrument for kids. Also we have a [xylophone](https://www.agreatlifebrand.com/products-glockenspiel-xylophone-for-kids-best-for-your-little-musician "A Great Life"). Both are mapped. Kids change their mind a lot. There's an instrument dropdown for that.

Fork the repo and map all the instruments in _your_ house. I dare you.

The application lets you select any transpositions available for whatever diatonically or otherwise limited instrument you have sitting around in your playroom. This functionality makes me happy!  My kids haven't noticed yet. I point it out whenever I can. They still haven't noticed... yet :grin:

What else? Oh yes, some songs have levels. One-star levels essentially show the notes you would sing, the tune as it were. Higher levels are more complex (read, more interesting) multiple-note situations that more resemble the chord backings overlaid. Those are overlaid so I can play guitar or piano along with. This makes me happy :grin:

Happy playing!
